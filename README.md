# Superstore Sales Data Analysis (Python EDA)
This repository contains the code and documentation for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Superstore sales data using Python.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/HloHarshit/Superstore-Sales-Python-EDA.git). It includes information about sales transactions at a superstore. Here are the columns in the dataset:

- **Row ID**: Unique identifier for each row.
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **Order Date**: Date when the order was placed.
- **Ship Date**: Date when the order was shipped.
- **Ship Mode**: Shipping mode used for the order (e.g., Standard Class, Express).
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Customer Name**: Name of the customer.
- **Segment**: Customer segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate).
- **City**: City where the order was placed.
- **State**: State where the order was placed.
- **Product ID**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **Category**: Category of the product.
- **Sub-Category**: Sub-category of the product.
- **Product Name**: Name of the product.
- **Sales**: Sales amount for the transaction.
- **Quantity**: Quantity of products sold.
- **Discount**: Discount applied to the transaction.
- **Profit**: Profit amount for the transaction.
- **Shipping Cost**: Cost of shipping.
- **Order Priority**: Priority of the order.
